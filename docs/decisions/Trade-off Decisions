Trade-off Decisions
IoT Core vs Direct S3


    IoT Core chosen for secure, real-time data streaming.


    Alternative: Direct S3 ingestion via API Gateway (simpler but no real-time guarantees).


Serverless vs EC2


    Serverless chosen to reduce cost and ops overhead.


    Trade-off: Cold-start latency on Lambdas (acceptable for alerts).


Storage choice (S3 + DynamoDB)


    Combination chosen to balance cost and performance.


    Trade-off: Maintaining sync pipelines between S3 and DynamoDB.
