Scaling Approach
    IoT Core – Handles thousands of devices natively; current load ~200 PLCs well within limits.
    Kinesis Data Streams – Auto-scale by adding shards during traffic spikes.
    DynamoDB – On-demand capacity for unpredictable MES queries.
    Lambda – Scales horizontally with event load.
    S3 – Virtually infinite storage.


Future-proofing:
    If device count grows → use IoT Device Defender for fleet security.
    If analytics needed → plug Kinesis → Firehose → Redshift for BI.
