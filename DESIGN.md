# Otee IoT Architecture â€“ Focused Design

## ðŸ“Œ Architecture Flow Diagram
The full IoT ingestion and processing architecture is designed in Figma:  
ðŸ‘‰ [View Diagram Here](https://www.figma.com/make/dLdp58bJ8iaAWDIIbQTvvl/IoT-Architecture-Flow-Diagram?fullscreen=1)

This diagram highlights:
- **Data ingestion flow** from PLC devices to storage and downstream consumers.
- **Network security boundaries** (VPC, private subnets, security groups).
- **Relevant AWS services** used in the ingestion pipeline.

## ðŸ“Š Data Flow (PLC â†’ Storage)

1. **PLC Devices**  
   - Connect securely using **MQTT/TLS with X.509 certificates**.
   - Messages published to AWS IoT Core.

2. **AWS IoT Core**  
   - Acts as the device gateway (authentication + topic routing).
   - Rules forward data into **Kinesis Data Streams**.

3. **Kinesis Data Streams**  
   - Handles high-throughput ingestion with auto-scaling shards.
   - Provides real-time feed to **Lambda functions** for anomaly detection.

4. **AWS Lambda**  
   - Processes events in real-time.
   - Example: If `temperature > 100Â°C`, publish alert to **SNS**.
   - Writes transformed data into DynamoDB.

5. **Amazon DynamoDB / Amazon S3**  
   - DynamoDB for **low-latency MES queries**.  
   - S3 for **raw event storage & analytics**.

6. **Amazon API Gateway**  
   - Secure API layer for MES to query processed data.

## ðŸ”’ Network Security Boundaries
- All services are deployed in **EU region VPC**.  
- **IoT Core â†’ Kinesis â†’ Lambda** interactions restricted via **IAM least-privilege roles**.  
- **Security Groups** restrict traffic flow (ingestion layer only allows necessary ports).  
- **Private subnets** for Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB access (no direct internet).  
- **Encryption** enabled at rest (KMS) and in transit (TLS).  

---

## ðŸ§© Relevant AWS Services
- **AWS IoT Core** â€“ Device connectivity (MQTT/TLS).  
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** â€“ Real-time ingestion.  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Anomaly detection + transformation.  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** â€“ Fast MES lookups.  
- **Amazon S3** â€“ Long-term data storage.  
- **Amazon API Gateway** â€“ Secure MES integration.  
- **Amazon SNS** â€“ Real-time alerts.  
- **Amazon CloudWatch** â€“ Monitoring, logging, metrics.

## âœ… Notes
- Design favors **serverless-first** â†’ no EC2.  
- Optimized for **99.9% uptime** with managed AWS services.  
- Scales automatically (IoT â†’ Kinesis shards â†’ Lambda concurrency).
